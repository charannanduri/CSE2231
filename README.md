This GitHub code is for my (Charan's) personal use. do not copy this code. I am not responsible
for any resulting action by any governing body based upon the use of the code in my (Charan's) personal repository.
This repository is for my personal use.
This repository is used to better manage my files on my computer and for no other reason.
I use the repository to quickly store code so that it does not use up large space and mess
up my organized file system within my computer. It also allows me to use multiple different computers while I am
developing a program.
Again, do not copy any code within this repository.
And once again, I am not responsible for any action taken by ANY governing body based on the use of this code.
I cannot stress this enough. Do. Not. Copy. My. Code.
